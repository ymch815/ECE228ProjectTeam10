## Introduction

There are three folders within this project: Diagnostic_data, Self_constructed_CNN and Pre_trained_model, which corresponds to the three parts of the project. 

Diagnostic_data -- ML methods applied on the diagnostic (tabular) dataset.
Self_constructed_CNN -- VGG-16-like CNN applied on the image dataset.
Pre_trained_model -- Several pretrained CNN models applied on the image dataset.


## Run the Code

There are mainly jupyter notebooks for all the three methods, should be easy to run. Make sure you have Pytorch installed and the corresponding dataset downloaded.

Also, it would be better to use GPU for the CNN training with the image dataset.
